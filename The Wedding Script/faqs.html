                    Turns out it's your "ring finger" for a reason.
                </div>
                <div class="show show1">
                    Engagement and wedding rings are worn on the fourth finger of the left hand because it was once
                    thought that a vein in that finger led directly to the heart.

                    Why do brides wear a white wedding dress?
                </div>
                <div class="show show2">
                    Queen Victoria is credited with starting the Western world's white wedding dress trend in 1840 —
                    before then, brides simply wore their best dress.
                </div>
                <div class="flip flip3">
                    Matching bridesmaids are good luck.
                </div>
                <div class="show show3">
                    The tradition of matching maids dates back to Roman times, when people believed evil spirits would
                    attend the wedding in an attempt to curse the bride and groom (how rude). Bridesmaids were required
                    to dress exactly like the bride in order to confuse the spirits and bring luck to the marriage.
                </div>
                <div class="flip flip4">
                    As are wedding veils.
                </div>
                <div class="show show4">
                    On a similar note, brides traditionally wear veils because ancient Greeks and Romans believed they
                    protected her from evil spirits.
                </div>
                <div class="flip flip5">
                    As the old saying goes...
                </div>
                <div class="show show5">
                    The tradition of a bride wearing "something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue,"
                    comes from an Old English rhyme. Something old represents continuity; something new offers optimism
                    for the future; something borrowed symbolizes borrowed happiness; something blue stands for purity,
                    love, and fidelity.

                    Let them eat cake.
                </div>
                <div class="show show6">
                    The tradition of a wedding cake comes from ancient Rome, where guests broke a loaf of bread over the
                    bride's head for fertility's sake.
                </div>
                <div class="flip flip7">
                    Ever wondered where the phrase "tying the knot" came from?
                </div>
                <div class="show show7">
                    In many cultures around the world—including Celtic, Hindu, and Egyptian weddings—the hands of the
                    bride and groom are literally tied together to demonstrate the couple's commitment to each other and
                    their new bond.
                </div>
                <div class="flip flip8">
                    If you thought we were over the spirit thing, think again.

                <div class="show show8">
                    According to tradition, the groom carries the bride across the threshold to valiantly protect her
                    from evil spirits lurking below.

                    The Roman goddess Juno rules over marriage and childbirth, hence the popularity of June weddings.
